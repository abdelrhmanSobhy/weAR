## Critical technical findings
1. `router.tsx` currently redirects `/customer` to `/customer/dashboard`, which renders `ComingSoonPage`.
2. `StorePage.tsx` is a centered placeholder and is not wired as the customer storefront.
3. Customer auth stores profile data in a shared retailer-shaped `RetailerProfile`. This is workable temporarily but should be narrowed with customer selectors/types instead of spreading retailer-specific assumptions.
4. `customerAuth.api.ts` has envelope/profile fallbacks including `retailerProfile`; preserve compatibility until backend responses are verified, then simplify with tests.
5. No customer domain query layer or reusable storefront component set exists yet.

## Recommended route map
```text
/customer
  /home
  /shop
  /products/:productId
  /compare
  /favorites
  /avatar
  /avatar/manual
  /avatar/photo
  /try-on
  /try-on/:productId
  /try-on/history
  /outfits
  /account
  /account/addresses
  /cart                 # frontend-only initially
  /checkout             # frontend-only initially
  /orders               # blocked/fixture only
  /orders/:orderId      # blocked/fixture only
  /shipping-returns
  /about
  /blog
```

`/customer` and legacy `/customer/dashboard` should redirect to `/customer/home` after migration.

## Continuation status refresh (2026-06-14)

- Commands 12–17: complete.
- Command 18: Avatar and Try-on contract alignment — complete.
- Saved Outfits: list/create/delete complete; detail/update blocked by backend 500.
- AI Outfit Suggestions (Command 19): complete — generate runtime-verified (2026-06-14); save Swagger-only (save blocked because deployed generate response contained no suggestionId). Adapter normalizes three response shapes (deployed direct-array, Swagger envelope, legacy direct-array). Fields: title→name, description→styleNotes, items→products, matchPercentage, styleTags, suggestionId: string|null. No synthetic ID. Save disabled when suggestionId null. INVALID_OUTFIT_ITEMS guidance with Favorites link; no auto-mutation.
- Wardrobe Collections (Command 20): **Complete — fully runtime-aligned (second batch 2026-06-14).** List: direct array, after add shows itemCount+coverImageUrl. Create 201 UUID; duplicate name → 409 CONFLICT handled (form stays open). Rename PATCH { newName } → 204; blank → 422 InvalidName handled. Delete 204 runtime-verified (subsequent GET confirmed). Add item 204; idempotent duplicate 204. Post-add list items → 500 backend defect (UI shows error/retry; add reports success). Remove item Swagger-only/runtime-blocked. customerId from authenticated state only. No Favorites/Outfits invalidation. Route: /customer/wardrobe/collections. Nav: "Wardrobe".
- Fit Feedback: blocked/planned Command 21 (requires real order IDs).
- Final release polish: Command 22.
